Fixed Bugs:
1. Fix the issue that the NTB will lose link after rebooting and reloading ntb related drivers.

User Guide:
1. Run "uname -r" to get the kernel version information;
2. Enter the directory "psx-switchtec-release". 
3. For example, if your kernel version is 4.14.***, you can run "make 4.14". 
   Then the code branch "switchtec-kernel-release_4.13_to_4.14" will be built, the "load_ntb_mod.sh" will be run, so the switchtec related drivers will be loaded.
4. In the script "load_ntb_mod.sh", you can change the eth0 IP address by modifingtwo places in the script:
   (1) ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 
   (2) echo -e "BOOTPROTO=static\nIPADDR=192.168.1.100\n..."
   Note: The two places IP addresses in the script should be set the same. 
		 The IP addresses of eth0 of the two canisters in the same chassis need to be set in the same network segment.
5. The script "auto_load_ntb.sh" is used to auto load switchtec related drivers after rebooting.
   This has been set in the Makefile, you don't need to execute this script separately.
6. If your kernel version is 4.14.***, you can run "make 4.14_clean" to clean the built files and unload switchtec and NTB related drivers.
